-- * I know *exactly* what you mean.
-- * Let me tell you why you're here.
-- * You're here because you know something.
-- * What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
-- * You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.
-- * You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
-- * It is this feeling that has brought you to me.
-- * Do you know what I'm talking about?

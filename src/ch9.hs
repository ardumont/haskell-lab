-- Nim is a game that is played on a board comprising five numbered rows of stars, which is initially set up as follows:
-- 1:∗∗∗∗∗
-- 2:∗∗∗∗
-- 3:∗∗∗
-- 4:∗∗
-- 5:∗
-- Two players take it in turn to remove one or more stars from the end of a single row.
-- The winner is the player who removes the last star or stars from the board.
-- Implement the game of nim in Haskell.

-- _Hint:_ represent the board as a list comprising the number of stars remaining on each row, with the initial board being =[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]=.

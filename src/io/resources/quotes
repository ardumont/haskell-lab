I think programmers have become
inured to incidental complexity...
when they encounter complexity,
they consider it a challenge to overcome,
rather than an obstacle to remove.
Overcoming complexity isn't work, it's waste.

I'm
trying
to
free
your
mind,
Neo.
But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it.

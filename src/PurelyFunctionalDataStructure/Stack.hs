module PurelyFunctionalDataStructure.Stack where

-- Exercise 2.1 Write a function suffixes of type a list -» a list list that takes a
-- list xs and returns a list of all the suffixes of xs in decreasing order of length.
-- For example,
-- suffixes [1,2,3,4] = [[1,2,3,4], [2,3,4], [3,4], [4], [ ] ]
-- Show that the resulting list of suffixes can be generated in O(n) time and represented in O(n) space.

suffixes [] = [[]]
suffixes l@(_:xs) = [l] ++ suffixes xs

-- λ> suffixes [1,2,3,4]

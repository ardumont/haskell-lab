module BinarySearchTree where

{--
Given the following binary Tree data type, provide an implementation of all functions
defined in this file.
Note that this definition is totaly lazy and that there is no constraints defined on elements
that will be associated with each Node.

Three may be declared as : data (Ord a) => Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
but it is not the right option.

To enforce the property of Binary Search Trees, functions that insert elements in the
given Tree must be implemeted in such a way that the invariant of a binary search tree always hold.
